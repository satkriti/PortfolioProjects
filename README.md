Hi There!

Welcome to my portfolio projects.

I have undertaken 4 projects for my first Data Analyst Portfolio:

1. I have cleaned COVID data from MyWorldinData in MYSQL 8.0
2. Then I extracted the scripts to each individual excels and visualised them in Tableau
3. Then I took the Nashville housing dataset to complete data cleaning and exploratory data analysis in SQL.
4. Lastly, I have used a dataset from Kaggle to identify correlations in Python.

All the files are attached to the portfolio along with the dataset.

Thanks for stopping by and contact me if you need any clarifications!
