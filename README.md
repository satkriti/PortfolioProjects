Hi There!

Welcome to my portfolio projects.

I have undertaken 4 projects for my first Data Analyst Portfolio:

1. I have cleaned covid data from MyWorldinData in MYSQL 8.0
2. Then I have extracted the scripts to each individual excels and visualised them in Tableau
3. Then I have taken the Nashville housing dataset to perform complete data cleaning and exploratory data analysis in SQL.
4. Lastly, I have used a dataset from Kagglet o indentify correlation in python.

All the files are attached in the portfolio along with dataset.

Thanks for stopping by and reach out to me if you need any clarifications!
